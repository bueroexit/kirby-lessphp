kirby-lessphp
=============

Lessphp for KirbyCMS.

This is a preprocessor for LESS files.
Built using the lessphp library by Leaf Corcoran.
This plugin will automatically process LESS-Files.


1. Copy the lessc.inc.php in the subfolder "lessphp" inside Kirby's plugin folder.
2. Copy the less.php inside Kirby's snippet folder.
3. Call the snippet with 	<?php snippet('less') ?>.
4. Putt your style.less inside the assets/less folder.

If some of these folders doesn't exist create them first.

I don't have tested it actually with Kirby 2 Version.
